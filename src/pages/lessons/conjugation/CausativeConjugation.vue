                    <p>The causative verb form in Japanese expresses the idea of making someone do something or letting
                        them
                        do something. In English, it's similar to saying "to make [someone] do [something]" or "to let
                        [someone] do [something]."</p>
                    <span>For example:</span>
                    <ul class="mx-4 mx-md-8">
                        <li>"I made my brother eat lunch."</li>
                        <li>"She let her child play outside."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In Japanese, the causative form is created by modifying the verb's base form. Below are the
                        conjugation rules for different verb types, followed by examples in both polite and casual
                        speech.

                        To express letting or allowing someone do something, the causative form is used, but the nuance
                        is
                        different from "making" someone do it. The causative form in this context is often translated as
                        "to
                        let" or "to allow".
