                <p>Kanji (漢字) are the adopted Chinese characters used in the Japanese writing system. Alongside
                    hiragana
                    and katakana, kanji are one of the three scripts that make up written Japanese.Each kanji character
                    represents a meaning (or concept), and often has multiple readings depending on

                <h5 class="text-h6 font-weight-bold">A Brief History</h5>
                <label>Kanji originated from Chinese characters and were introduced to Japan over 1,500 years ago. At
                    first,
                    they were used mainly by scholars and monks, but over time they became a core part of everyday
                    Japanese writing.</label>
